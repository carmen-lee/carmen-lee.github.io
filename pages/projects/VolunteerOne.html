          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <h4>Abstract</h4>
          <p>
            VolunteerOne is a peer-based mobile app that aims to connect
            volunteers to their communities through posted opportunities and
            events. Its purpose is to increase community engagement and
            emphasize input from volunteers on their skills, interests, and
            experience to match suitable opportunities and create more impactful
            contributions. Features include clear communication channels between
            organizations and volunteers, hour tracking for groups looking to
            volunteer together, and various social features, including sharing
            experiences with friends, family, and organizations.
          </p>

          <h4>Executive Summary</h4>
          <p>
            VolunteerOne is a modern volunteering approach that aims to simplify
            and streamline the volunteering experience for both organizations
            and volunteers. Our one-stop solution includes a management system
            that facilitates communication, searching for volunteer
            opportunities, and consistency. Unlike other products with a similar
            goal, such as VolunteerMatch [1], we have taken into account the
            dissatisfaction of users with confusing layouts and layouts with
            overwhelming details. Our mobile app is designed to be simple,
            user-friendly, and interactive, addressing the main issue at heart:
            how to increase community engagement through accessibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            We have addressed major problems that occur in current volunteer
            management services, problems such as handling communication and
            coordination, using volunteer skills effectively, and managing
            volunteer burnout, as noted by volunteering logistics company
            Volgistics [2]. In order to address these problems, our app features
            multiple communication channels, including an announcement board for
            organizations to keep information up-to-date for their new and
            existing volunteer opportunities. It also displays key details for
            those opportunities and events in a succinct and visually appealing
            way, allowing volunteers to make well-informed decisions about how
            they can make an impact in their community. Additionally, we have
            included a social aspect to our app, allowing users to interact with
            friends and family, allowing them to share their experiences,
            photos, and the other activities they participate in.
          </p>
          <p>
            VolunteerOne is meant to be the first place people look for anything
            related to volunteering. It is a full-service app designed to
            benefit its community. Volunteers and organizations looking for ways
            to interact with their community will benefit greatly from
            VolunteerOne.

          <h4>Personal Contribution</h4>
          <img

            src="/images/projects/volunteerone/VolunteerOne_TeamPhoto.png"
            alt="Team Photo"
          />
          <p>
            As the project manager and lead of the frontend team, I contributed
            to the planning, design, functionality, and review of the mobile
            app. After choosing a suitable theme for our mobile app, I cleaned
            the theme repository and created the skeleton for the app to act as
            the foundation for everyone else to build upon. I built the
            navigation that would route screens in the correct order, and styled
            the layout that would be used throughout the app. I also managed the
            frontend team by creating and delegating tasks to implement key
            features in a timely manner so that our project would be finished
            within our timeline of 3 months. Lastly, I conducted code reviews to
            maintain coding standards for the team.

          <h3>Motivation</h3>
          <h5>
            Understanding the volunteer market: The what, where, who and why of
            Volunteering.
          </h5>
          <p>
            In this survey paper published in 2002 by Bussell and Forbes, they
            claim that recruiting and retaining volunteers requires
            understanding the target market by understanding what volunteering
            is, who volunteers, where it occurs, and why people volunteer. The
            authors present the relevant literature on these four problems,
            attempting to define each area as well as probe the current
            problems. To understand the success of an organization's ability to
            recruit and retain volunteers, the article analyzes prior research
            and current metrics with regard to the donation of time. This
            concludes to the understanding of volunteer motivations which prove
            to not simply be due to altruism. [3]
          </p>
          <p>
            With the design of VolunteerOne, we tackle the volunteer problem by
            considering specifically the who and why of volunteering. Brussel
            and Forbes explain how other studies found younger people are less
            likely to volunteer than those over 50 [3]. VolunteerOne aims to
            help organizations rectify this age variability by implementing a
            system that lowers the friction needed to start volunteering and
            incentivizes it through social connections and statistics.
            Furthermore, Brussel and Forbes identified multiple "whys" for
            volunteers - from seeking to help others, to the ability to gain
            skills, value alignment, and egoistic motives [3]. VolunteerOne
            recognizes the different motivating values and seeks to appeal to
            those with features such as interest matching and organization pages
            so prospective volunteers can choose organizations and events
            serving missions vital to them. This article helped shed light on
            some of the fundamental problems with understanding and acquiring
            volunteers, allowing VolunteerOne to deliver a technical solution.
          </p>

          <h5>Volunteer Motivation and Satisfaction</h5>
          <p>
            Volunteer Motivation and Satisfaction, an article by Hyejin Bang and
            Stephen D. Ross examines the motives behind volunteers.
            Historically, theories on the motivation of volunteering have been
            attributed to altruism, social contact, personal interests, and
            emotional needs [4]. Studies have shown that many of the reasons for
            volunteering are to satisfy individual needs or interests and the
            primary reason for volunteering was not altruistic.The purpose of
            the study is to conduct research on the scale development of
            volunteer motivation [4]. One result of the study finds that it is
            imperative for volunteering event managers to understand the
            motivations of volunteers and how each volunteer can be assisted in
            achieving a sense of personal satisfaction [4].
          </p>
          <p>
            This article notes that the way younger individuals view
            volunteering has shifted from how older generations viewed it. As
            stated, one of the primary reasons for volunteering for new
            generations is to satisfy individual needs and interests. With
            VolunteerOne, we are catering to the younger individuals by creating
            a social network platform centered around volunteering, and we
            enable users to select events that align with their personal
            interests. By modernizing how volunteering recruitment is done, we
            approach the process with a more fun and social aspect that will
            continue to attract newer generations to volunteering.

            Meanings of Organizational Volunteering: Diverse Volunteer Pathways
          </h5>
          <p>
            Being a volunteer means many things and takes many shapes. As
            expressed in the article Meanings of Organizational Volunteering:
            Diverse Volunteer Pathways by Kirstie McAllum, there exists what one
            may call volunteering pathways. The article explores the motivations
            and reasons for volunteering. As well as, the benefit that comes
            from volunteering both for the individual and the organization [5].
            More importantly, the study is unable to define volunteering as
            “participants struggled to pinpoint which type of activities could
            be considered volunteering” [5]. However, it does shine a light on
            some potential different types of pathways named
            “freedom–reciprocity” and “giving–obligation” [5]. The article goes
            more in-depth on what each of these pathways means and how
            individuals benefit from volunteering, how they interact with
            organizations, and how they behave after volunteering is no longer
            an option.
          </p>
          <p>
            This article showcases that participants may volunteer to achieve a
            prefer-self under “freedom-reciprocity” while those under the
            “giving-obligation” pathway aim to achieve a sense of ideal-self
            [5]. Regardless of what pathway an individual is seeking to take,
            VolunteerOne is the perfect idea to help everyone achieve their
            individual goals. With a centralized hub of opportunities, users
            looking for casual opportunities can find them. The user looking to
            volunteer more often and on a more personal level can also find
            opportunities. Or for those who have stopped volunteering and are
            seeking to come back [5] for one more shift. Regardless of the needs
            and motivations behind the user, VolunteerOne is the tool that will
            help them find what they need.

          <h4>Backend Architecture</h4>
          <img

          <p class="caption">Figure 2.1: Backend architecture</p>

          <p>
            From a high level perspective, the backend architecture, shown in
            Figure 2.1, is broken down into two separate docker containers: the
            app and database containers. This design choice was made for easy
            and consistent deployment for not only local testing, but actual
            production hosting on the server. With Docker, we can have one
            script which provisions all necessary containers and dependencies,
            in order for our app to function properly no matter where it's being
            hosted.
          </p>

          <img
            class="project-pic"
            src="/images/projects/volunteerone/Controller_Service_Repo.png"
          />
          <p class="caption">
            Figure 2.2: Controller, Service, and Repository Design
          </p>

          <p>
            The backend architecture follows the Controller, Service, Repository
            design model. This design model was chosen because it allows
            abstraction between different layers of the application. The benefit
            of this abstraction will be detailed heavily in this section.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Controller layer contains the public facing handles for routes
            of the API. HTTP requests from the client are made to these routes,
            and the controller layer contains the method interfaces necessary to
            consume these requests. For example, the /signup route for the API
            is handled by a Signup() method implemented as a LoginController.
            Specific implementation details will be in section C where
            architecture for individual use cases are described.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Service layer contains business logic that the Controllers use.
            For example, when a user signs up, their password must be hashed
            before it’s placed in the database. Instead of implementing this
            functionality directly in the controller, this logic is implemented
            as a service method, which is called by the controller instead.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Repository layer contains all logic which interacts directly
            with the database. Only at this layer will actual calls to the
            database be allowed.
          </p>

          <h3>Success Report</h3>
          <h4>Frontend</h4>
          <p>
            Initially, our main goal for the mobile application was to create a
            minimum viable app that contained all the necessary screens
            correctly routed together. As we have completed that goal with more
            than 15 different screens and seamless navigation, our next goal was
            to enhance our app by creating an accessible, interactive, and
            personable experience for our users. We continued to deliver
            features that would serve those objectives through our quick swipe,
            post reactions(like/comment), and user skills feature. Since making
            those additions to our app, we have met our goals and objectives.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although we created an intuitive volunteering app, we acknowledge
            that we could have expanded it further to benefit our target
            audience even more. We had considered features like hour logging and
            an event scheduler, but due to time constraints and the complexity
            of previous and new tasks, we were unable to implement them.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our approach to creating an effective user interface for our mobile
            app set us up for success. By using React Native as our framework,
            we utilized its strength of code reusability. We were able to plan
            and structure our project with reusable components and it not only
            made the project more collaborative and efficient, but it also made
            the code more readable. By starting with a well-thought out and
            structured project skeleton, it made it possible to develop and
            build upon one another’s contributions with ease. Our approach
            worked well for our team dynamic and we would strongly recommend
            planning a project with an approach similar to ours.
          </p>

          <h4>Backend</h4>
          <p>
            Since the first design document, a large portion of the API is
            complete. We have implemented all the requirement endpoints needed.
            The JWT protocol authentication has since been added as a feature so
            our endpoints are secure through the authentication middleware.
            Since this is implemented it was very easy to apply to all of the
            protected routes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Currently, most of the test coverages are relatively high in
            comparison from the last document. Refactoring for unit testing has
            been the hardest factor since adopting the new Controller, Service,
            and Repository architecture. Because we chose to use GORM and
            Golang, the testing portion of this project has been the longest and
            most difficult problem. In addition, the Docker setup was highly
            faulty on some members’ computers. It mainly worked half the time,
            but when it did. We were able to test the code using GOBCO, Postman,
            and etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Our final backend was successfully completed with less problems that
            we had initially thought. Thankfully, we were able to get all APIs
            working. The full backend team agrees that learning GO and GORM for
            this one project was a risky idea. Only one person fully knew how GO
            and GORM worked, while the rest of the team had to learn it while
            producing results. We were all able to finish our tasks, but had we
            chosen a language we all were comfortable with, the project would
            have gone faster and smoother. Furthermore, we should have
            emphasized deploying our web server and CI pipeline from the very
            beginning, that way we could have iterated more slowly and
            methodically.
          </p>

          <h4>Full Team</h4>
          <p>
            The full team has gone through this semester with many sleepless
            nights while trying to learn new tasks that they have never tried
            before. We as a team were able to complete the app, and complete
            issues at hand as a team. There were many miscommunication issues,
            however, we all were able to work through it. Our teams were well
            put together and think it was the best idea to split the team from
            backend and front end.
